## My process
I created a div for the container, then created a container for the two pieces of text and some margins. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

This challenge made me aware that I still have a lot to learn in web development. Of course, I have a lot of theoretical knowledge, but this simple challenge made me reaise that I needed to continue practising my skills until I really know them.


### Continued development

I would like to learn floats and how to work with them. That technique has already been replaced by Flexbox and Grid, but I would like to learn it just in case.
